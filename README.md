# UtilityKit

Mostly static utility classes that are used across multiple projects. This seems like a better place for them than in individual Gists.


#### SerializationUtil

Wrapper for dealing with BinaryFormatter in a way that works on AOT/IL2CPP and regular platforms



#### ObjectInspector

Generic Object Editor that provides the default inspector along with some additional goodies like Vector3 collection editing in the scene view and clickable buttons to call methods


#### StripGeneratedSolutionSettings

Fixes the cruft that Unity injects into MonoDevelop solution files



#### MathHelpers

Various mathy helpers that I find myself using often



#### ConstantsGeneratorKit

Generates constant classes for Layers, Resources, Scenes, Tags and SortingLayers. No more naked strings all over the place! It has it's own README markdown file with more information.
